   7. Click **Deploy** and monitor your deployment

   

### 2. Check WAS VM

If the Template has deployed successfully, you should have a virtual machine with WebSphere Application Server installed and  up and running. 

##### Check the status of the WAS App Server

1. SSH into the App Server vm

   ```
   ssh root@10.0.0.(WAS App Server vm IP)
   ```

2. Change to the profile directory

   ```
   cd /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/AppSrv01/logs/server1
   ```

3. Check startServer log, run

   ```
   cat startServer.log
   ```

   You should see "**open for e-business**" at the bottom of the log

##### Update the firewall rules for the WebSphere Admin Console

1. Run the commands below to open the port for the WAS Admin Console

   ```
   firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=9060/tcp
   firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=9043/tcp
   firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=9080/tcp
   ```

2. Reload the firewall rules

   ```
   firewall-cmd --reload
   ```

3. Verify the rules are active

   ```
   firewall-cmd --list-all
   ```

   You should see the following output

   â€‹	![Lab_4-2_B](../images/Lab_4-2_B.png)

4. Next we will open the WAS Admin Console 

   - Open the Chrome web browser from the Boot Node and navigate to the URL below:
     ```
     http://10.0.0.<WAS VM IP>:9060/ibm/console
     ```

   - Login with the credentials below

     User id = wasadmin

     Password = passw0rd

### 3. Deploy simple application

1. Copy Sample WAS Application to WAS VM

   - From the boot node copy the sample application .war file to the new WAS virtual machine

     ```
     scp ~/Documents/cam-admin-bootcamp/WAS_App/WLPDemoApp1.0.war root@10.0.0.<WAS VM IP>:/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/AppSrv01/installableApps
     ```

2. Open WebSphere admin console

   - Open the Chrome web browser from the Boot Node and navigate to the URL below:
     ```
     http://10.0.0.<WAS VM IP>:9060/ibm/console
     ```

   - Login with the credentials below

     User id = wasadmin

     Password = passw0rd

3. In the admin console go to **Application > New Application**

   - Select **New Enterprise Application**

   - Select **Remote File System** (you are running the admin console remotely from your WAS VM )

     - Browse, select **team#washosteNode01**

     - Drive down into the **/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/AppSrv01/installableApps** directory

     - Select the **WLPDemoApp1.0.war** file

       ![Lab_4-2_D](../images/Lab_4-2_D.png)

     - Select **OK**

     - Select **Next**

     - Select **Fast Path**, then **Next**

     - Step 1 Select **Next**

     - Step 2 Select **WLPDempApp**, then **Next**

     - Step 3 Select **WLPDemoApp**, then **Next**

     - Step 4 enter **WLPDemoAppV1Team#** for context root, then **Next**

     - Step 5 select **Next**

     - Step 6 select **Finish**

     - Select **save** to save the changes to the master configuration

4. Restart the WebSphere server

   - SSH into WebSphere virtual machine

     ```
     ssh root@10.0.0.<WAS VM IP>
     ```

   - Change directory to the  App Server bin directory

     ```
     cd /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/profiles/AppSrv01/bin
     ```

   - Stop the server

     ```
     ./stopServer.sh server1
     ```

     You should see the following output

     ![Lab_4-2_E](../images/Lab_4-2_E.png)

     

   - Start the server

     ```
     ./startServer.sh server1
     ```
     
     You should see the following output
     
     ![Lab_4-2_F](../images/Lab_4-2_F.png)

   

5. Make sure App is started

   - On the Boot Node return to the Chrome broswere where you have the WebSphere Amin Console open

   - Navigate to **Applications > Application Types** and then select **WebSphere enterprise applications**

   - You should see a green arrow next to the **WLPDemoApp1_0_war**

     ![Lab_4-2_G](../images/Lab_4-2_G.png)

6. Open the Application

   - From the Chrome browser navigate to the URL below:
     ```
     http://10.0.0.<WAS VM IP>:9080/WLPDemoAppV1Team#/DemoApp_Begin.jsp
     ```

     You should see the following out put
     
     ![Lab_4-2_H](../images/Lab_4-2_H.png)

#### Lab Completion Clean Up

To remove the instances used during this lab and the previous one, first remove the WAS VM via CAM **Menu** -> **Deployed Instances** -> **Templates**.

Next remove the content runtime VM using via CAM **Menu** -> **Manage** -> **Content Runtimes**. Click on the 3 dots to the right of the instance created and click on '**Destroy Resources**' followed by '**Delete Instance**'
